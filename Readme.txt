Hi!

Thanks for downloading my app and help me out to distribute it all over the NET.
Now on I will explain how it works:

*********************************************************************************

- It's built for a robot, based on an Android 5.0 operative system, you could talk to.
  Coded on VS Community + Xamarin, it's also tested in Android 7.0 platforms and works well.

- It's got predefined Spanish voice commands using Google API for the speaking, so 
  an Internet connection is strictly required to use it.

- At the same time, you're able to teach it new voice commands as well as their responses 
  by adding them (or deleting) in a SQLite Database.

 WARNING!

- Next repositories are required: Mono.Android + PCL.Storage + SQLite.NET + Xamarin.Forms
- I've only uploaded the source code and the .XML layout
- Do not forget to enable recording audio permission on Android Manifesto!
